### Refelction - Milestone 3

#### Dashboard Overview:

As a data scientist consultancy firm our goal for the project is to create a dashboard for the citizen or the population who wants to get idea of the World Sustaiabiity with respect to Social, Economic and Environmental indicators. The dashboard is to show the World Sustainability to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In other words, it is about finding a way to achieve economic, social, and environmental progress in a way that is sustainable over the long term. World Sustainability Dashboard is created to track the performance of 173 countries against a range of sustainability metrics over a 19-year period (From 2000 to 2018).

#### For the third milestone, we have done the following 4 tabs out of 5. 

Environmental Tab: The second tab is showing two graphs of environmental data. One graph is showing what proportion of the population is using the internet, given they have access to electricity. And the other graph is showing the proportion of adjusted savings: CO2 damage for given CO2 emission from production annually.

Social Tab: The third tab is showing social graphs. First graph is showing the literacy level of the selected country for the selected period. The second graph is showing the disparity between the employment of males and females for the selected country, year, and period.

Economic: The fourth tab is showing barplots of the Trade % of GPD per capita from 2000 to 2018 for the required country. It has legends for Imports and Exports.

Summary: The fifth tab is showing two graphs, one bubble chart for the inflation v/s GDP and other is how income classification is divided for the given country. The second is the pie chart showing the proportion of countries according to the income classification for a particular year. In this tab Income classification is multi-select whereas year is dropdown.

#### Development and bug for milestone 3

While we were putting together the dashboard for the milestone 3, we faced the following issues:

1.We are struggling to make the Year slider work for the environmmental tab. However. later the issues was resolved.
2.Had difficulty to format layouts as per the initial planning .
3.We had difficulty with deploying the app in Heroku, which was resolved later.

### Suggestion from TA from Milestone 1

1.For Environmental tab we have implemented one graph at the top and another at the bottom.
2.The graph size is increased as suggested in Milestone 1 along with width and height.
3.As suggested by our TA, we will working on adding information like top/worst 5 countries performing best in the summary tab to provide more insights.
4.We'll be concentrating more on beautifying the dash to resolve the scaling issues and other styling effects.

### Future Improvements & Additions

Following improvements and additions can be made to the dashboard to make this more user-friendly and effective:

-multiple country selection option except for single country selection
-can include different region so that users dont have to select multiple countires one by one i.e. with the region selection the countires under that region can be automatically selected.
-improved layout which will easity show us which tab is active with better alignment.
-for environmental tab, option to see the status based on the CO2 emission would have been better.
-for economic tab, filtering based on GDP rates would have been more effective for the users
